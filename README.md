# Blinks-Instructions-Assets
A library of illustrator files that can be used by anyone to create their own Blinks game instructions. We welcome other styles and formats for teaching games, and want to create a hub for shared resources and clear communication. Also, we've now got a place for the Blinks version of 8-bit art :)
